# HallmarkChannel Memory Matching Game

There is a ton of nostalgia here for me.

The code I was focused on is in `app-engine.js`.

Note this was 2012 and was my first project as a "professional" developer, so I opted to not use a framework to learn as much as I could.

The primary structure of the matching is a linked list in `app.cards`. This let sets the `match=` and the `set=` as integers which allow a simple `checkForMatch` function.

Lots of embarassing code in here too, but such is life as a beginner!

Images below (game works fully still to this day):
